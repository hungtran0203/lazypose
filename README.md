Lazypose
-----

Lazypose is a React Hook utility for building and combining React Hooks to single level Higher-order wrapper functional components.

[**Full API documentation**](docs/API.md) - Learn about each helper

```
npm install lazypose --save
```

## Why

When React version 16.8.0 is release with React Hook feature, `Recompose` is replaced and prefer to use over `Recompose`. Developer can re-write code by using React Hooks, but with React Hooks, testing will be not simple causes state, data is declared inside component. 

The main concept of `Lazypose` is to move all Reack Hooks to a single wrapper functional component. And then results of React Hooks are converted or mapped to props then passing to Dumb Presentation Component.

`Lazypose` provide utility to create function component that have several key advantages as stated in `recompose`:

- They help prevent abuse of the `setState()` API, favoring props instead.
- They encourage the ["smart" vs. "dumb" component pattern](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).
- They encourage code that is more reusable and modular.
- They discourage giant, complicated components that do too many things.
- Functions can be composed together.
- The code is easily tested.
- There arenâ€™t any observable side effects.
- The data is immutable.
- In the future, they will allow React to make performance optimizations by avoiding unnecessary checks and memory allocations.

### Higher-order components made easy

Most of the time when we talk about composition in React, we're talking about composition of components. For example, a `<Blog>` component may be composed of many `<Post>` components, which are composed of many `<Comment>` components.

Recompose focuses on another unit of composition: **higher-order components** (HoCs). HoCs are functions that accept a base component and return a new component with additional functionality. They can be used to abstract common tasks into reusable pieces.

Recompose provides a toolkit of helper functions for creating higher-order components.

## You can use Lazypose to...

### ...lift state, context, callbacks, handlers into functional wrappers

Helpers like `.withState()` provide a nicer way to express state updates:

```js
import lazypose from 'lazypose'
const enhancer = lazypose().withState('counter', 'setCounter', 0)
const Counter = enhancer.compose(({ counter, setCounter }) =>
  <div>
    Count: {counter}
    <button onClick={() => setCounter(n => n + 1)}>Increment</button>
    <button onClick={() => setCounter(n => n - 1)}>Decrement</button>
  </div>
)
```

### ...to inject data to renderProps pattern

Helpers like `.renderProps()` is used for inject additional state/data to renderProps pattern:

```js
<Downshift
  onChange={selection => alert(`You selected ${selection.value}`)}
  itemToString={item => (item ? item.value : '')}
>{
lazypose()
.withState('value', 'changeValue', ({ value }) => value.toLowerCase())
.renderProps(
  ({
      getInputProps,
      getItemProps,
      getLabelProps,
      getMenuProps,
      isOpen,
      inputValue,
      highlightedIndex,
      selectedItem,
    }) => (
      <div>
        <label {...getLabelProps()}>Enter a fruit</label>
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        <ul {...getMenuProps()}>
          {isOpen
            ? items
                .filter(item => !inputValue || item.value.includes(inputValue))
                .map((item, index) => (
                  <li
                    {...getItemProps({
                      key: item.value,
                      index,
                      item,
                      style: {
                        backgroundColor:
                          highlightedIndex === index ? 'lightgray' : 'white',
                        fontWeight: selectedItem === item ? 'bold' : 'normal',
                      },
                    })}
                  >
                    {item.value}
                  </li>
                ))
            : null}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
)
  }
  </Downshift>
```

### ...optimize rendering performance

Lazypose was heavily inspired by `recompose` and support most of enhancer privided by that library. Also Lazypose is written to resolve the main rendering performance disadvantage of recompose. While `recompose` produces each WrappingHOCComponent for each composed enhancer, `lazypose` produces only one WrappingHOCComponent
`Recompose way`
```js
const enhance = compose(
  withState('username', 'setUsername', '')
  withState('firstname', 'setFirstname', '')
  withState('lastname', 'setLastname', '')
  withHandlers({
    onSubmit: ({ username, firstname, lastname }) => () => {
      subbmitForm({ username, firstname, lastname })
    }
  }),
  lifecyle({
    componentDidMount() {
      loadUserData(this.props.username)
    }
  })
)(PresentationComponent)
```
`in React devtool inspection`
```js
  <withState(withState(withState(withHandlers(lifecyle))))>
    <withState(withState(withHandlers(lifecyle)))>
      <withState(withHandlers(lifecyle))>
        <withHandlers(lifecyle)>
          <lifecyle>
            <PresentationComponent />
          </lifecyle>          
        </withHandlers(lifecyle)>        
      </withState(withHandlers(lifecyle))>      
    </withState(withState(withHandlers(lifecyle)))>    
  </withState(withState(withState(withHandlers(lifecyle))))>  
```

`Lazypose way`
```js
const enhance = lazypose()
  .withState('username', 'setUsername', '')
  .withState('firstname', 'setFirstname', '')
  .withState('lastname', 'setLastname', '')
  .withHandlers({
    onSubmit: ({ username, firstname, lastname }) => () => {
      subbmitForm({ username, firstname, lastname })
    }
  }),
  .lifecyle({
    componentDidMount() {
      loadUserData(this.props.username)
    }
  })
  .compose(PresentationComponent)
```
`in React devtool inspection`
```js
  <LazyposeWrapper>
    <PresentationComponent />
  </LazyposeWrapper>  
```

### ...reuse enhancer or group of enhancers
```js
const formEnhancer = lazypose()
  .withState('formField1', 'setField1')
  .withState('formField2', 'setField2')
  .withState('formField3', 'setField3')
  
const ContainerComponent = formEnhancer
  .clone()
  .withHandlers({
    onSubmit: ({ formField1, formField2, formField3 }) => () => {
      subbmitForm1({ formField1, formField2, formField3 })
    }
  }),
  .compose(FORM1)
  
const ContainerComponent2 = formEnhancer
  .clone()
  .withState('formField4', 'setField4')
  .withHandlers({
    onSubmit: ({ formField1, formField2, formField3, formField4 }) => () => {
      subbmitForm2({ formField1, formField2, formField3, formField4 })
    }
  }),
  .compose(FORM1)
```

### ...interoperate with other React Hook libraries

Lazypose allows to add new enhancer by using `loadEnhancer` method

```js
lazypose().loadEnhancer({
  withWindowSize: (options) => (ownerProps) => {
     .....
  },
  withQuery: (options) => (ownerProps) => {
     .....
  },
  mapPropsStream: (options) => (ownerProps) => {
     .....
  },
});

// then
const Container = lazypose()
  .withWindowSize(options)
  .withQuery(options)
  .mapPropsStream(options)
  .compose(PRESENTATION)
```

### ...full control of props mapping flow
Lazypose maintain the order of enhancers pushed to lazypose to run the props mapping flow with the same order.
Also enhancers are kept in 3 difference queues: `init`, `defer` and `default` queue.
Where `init` queue is run first then `default` queue and `defer` queue is last.
By utilizing different queues properly, we can control to init nessesary props or clean up props easily
```js
const FORM = lazypose()
  .withConst('firstname').defer.omitProps('firstname')
  .withConst('lastname').defer.omitProps('lastname')
  .withConst('fullname', ({ firstname, lastname } ) => `${firstname} ${lastname}`
  .init.withState('field1', 'setField1')
```
